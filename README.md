# TSS Saver

An iOS app for [TSSSaver](https://tsssaver.1conan.com/).

# Compiling 

The project has no external dependancies (yay! :tada:). Open it in Xcode 8.3, and run it.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute, however, the code is currently very messy. I'm working on refactoring it, so pls no kill. You can check out the open issues to get an idea what to work on. For futher contribution chat, join [our discord](https://discord.gg/4sb8873).

# Issues

Please open an issue for any issues you have. Please note, sideload support is coming very soon, so stay tuned for that. When the app is sandboxed, it uses a hardcoded ECID for testing.
